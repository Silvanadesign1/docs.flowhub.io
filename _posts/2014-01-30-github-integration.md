When you log into Flowhub we will perform authentication with GitHub that grants Flowhub access to push to your public repositories. For paid accounts, we also provide access to your [private GitHub repositories](https://github.com/pricing).

## Enabling private GitHub repositories

1. Log into [app.flowhub.io](http://app.flowhub.io/)
2. Click "Settings"
3. Click the refresh icon under "Flowhub plan"
4. Click "Login" (authorize on GitHub)

Once complete, your account will read, "Everything up to date" in your settings panel.

## Push project to GitHub

If you don't have any projects yet, try the [getting started guide](../getting-started-browser/).

1.  Open a project that you want to push
2.  Open the project panel by clicking the left side of the screen
3.  Tap "Settings"  
4.  Input your GitHub name and repository name and save. If the repository doesn't exist it will be created for you on first push.

5.  You should now have an area to input a commit message and upload.
